## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does as well as any other information you want users or other developers to have.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone repository.
* Open code in your favorite text editor. I use VS Code.
* Run "npm install." in your terminal.
* Followed by "run npm build."
* [Find a free API here at this link](https://pokeapi.co)
* Save your API in a ".env file" for safe keeps. Then add this to your .gitignore file.
* Add "API_KEY=Your key here" to the .env file. 
* Make sure you test your API calls in Postman before adding them to your code.
* Check documentation on your API key to see endpoints and more useful information about your API.
* Run "npm run start" to view in browser.

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
